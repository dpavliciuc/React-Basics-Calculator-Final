# React-Basics-Calculator-Final
Meta React Basics Calculator app final project

##How to test:

#1. Delete the ".git".

#2. Navigate to the folder: "cd calculator-app".

#3. Open the folder with a terminal, or you could use the built in terminal inside VSCode.

#4.Run: "npm install" to fix brocken packages.

#5 Run: "chmod -R +x node_modules/.bin" to grant access for step 6.

#6 Start the live server by running "npm start".

#Note: If it does not work, I suggest looking up for possible fixes.

#Note2: I know the UI and UX isn't that good, that's because the main focus of this peoject was the logic behind it: "useState".
